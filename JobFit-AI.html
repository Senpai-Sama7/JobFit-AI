Thanks for clarifying! If you want to run and preview the JobFit-AI repo (which is a TypeScript-based web app) locally—similar to how you can preview projects on Replit—here’s how you can do it on your own machine:

---

## 1. Recommended Local IDEs

Any of these will work great:
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)** (most popular)
- **WebStorm** (commercial, powerful)
- **Sublime Text**, **Atom**, or any editor with terminal/Git support

---

## 2. Steps to Preview JobFit-AI Locally

Assuming you have **Node.js** and **npm** (Node Package Manager) installed:

### a. Clone the Repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Senpai-Sama7/JobFit-AI.git
cd JobFit-AI
```

### b. Install Dependencies
```sh
npm install
```

### c. Start the Development Server
Most modern TypeScript/React/Next.js/Vite projects support:
```sh
npm run dev
```
or sometimes:
```sh
npm start
```
Check the `package.json` in the repo for the exact script.

### d. Preview in Your Browser
The terminal will show a `localhost` URL (like `http://localhost:5173` or `http://localhost:3000`). Open this in your browser to preview the app live.

---

## 3. Optional: VS Code “Live Server”
If you’re just working with HTML, you can use the Live Server extension—but for this project, running with `npm run dev` is best.

---

## 4. Alternative: Online IDEs
If you want something like Replit, try:
- [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com)
- [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces) (integrates with GitHub, free for some users)
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)

These let you open the repo and preview it in-browser, often with zero setup!

---

**Summary:**  
The best experience is with VS Code locally, running the app with `npm run dev`. For a Replit-like experience, use StackBlitz or Codespaces.
