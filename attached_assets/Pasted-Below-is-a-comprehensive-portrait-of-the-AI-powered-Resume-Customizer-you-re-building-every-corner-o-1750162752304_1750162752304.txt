Below is a comprehensive portrait of the AI-powered Resume Customizer you’re building—every corner of its architecture, every beat of its user journey, every module pulsing with purpose.

1. Vision & Purpose

You’re crafting a next-level career partner—an app that absorbs a user’s raw data (typed form or uploaded résumé in DOCX, PDF, ODT, TXT, MD, even old-school RTF), teases out every skill, every accomplishment, every nuance, then breathes that essence into perfectly tailored resumes and role-fit recommendations. It’s not just a document editor. It’s a smart alchemist that refines user inputs into polished, ATS-safe, role-aligned outcomes—and whispers back the ideal job titles they should pursue.

2. Core User Journeys
	1.	Sign Up / Onboard
	•	Email/password or OAuth
	•	Quick tour: “Upload resume or fill form” → “See your skills profile” → “Tailor or explore role suggestions”
	2.	Ingesting Your Story
	•	Upload: Drag-and-drop DOCX, PDF, ODT, MD, TXT.
	•	Manual Fill: Step-by-step wizard for contact info, summary, work history, education, skills, extras.
	•	Preprocessing: OCR fallback for scanned PDFs; sanitization of odd characters; preserve bullet structure.
	3.	Automatic Parsing & Structuring
	•	Section Detection (NLP + heuristics) discovers Contact, Summary, Experience, Education, Skills, Certifications, Extras.
	•	Entity Extraction pulls out dates, company names, roles, metrics (“increased revenue by 32 %”), technology stacks.
	4.	Quality Evaluation
	•	ATS-Safety Check flags text boxes, nonstandard fonts, graphics.
	•	Layout Audit scores consistency of headings, fonts, whitespace.
	•	Content Audit surfaces missing quantifiable achievements, overused buzzwords, spelling or grammar glitches.
	5.	Role-Fit Recommendation
	•	UserProfile: concatenates summary + experience narrative + skill list.
	•	JobTaxonomy: a curated list of ~500 generic titles (Data Analyst, Product Manager, UX Designer…), each tagged with required skills and a 1–2 sentence descriptor.
	•	Hybrid Matching:
	•	Semantic Embeddings (sentence-transformers) compare user narrative vs. job descriptor.
	•	Keyword Overlap counts shared skills.
	•	Score Blend weights 70 % semantic, 30 % overlap.
	•	Output: top 5–10 titles with fit-scores.
	6.	Resume Tailoring
	•	Job Description Input: paste or upload the real JD; or choose one of the recommended generic roles.
	•	Keyword Mapping: extract JD’s action verbs, required skills, domain-specific buzz.
	•	Content Rebalancing:
	•	Reorder bullets so the most relevant appear first.
	•	Insert missing keywords into summary or skills if authentic.
	•	Elevate quant metrics by prompting user for numbers.
	•	Template Engine: Jinja2-style templates with variables for each section; CSS-like styling JSON to control font, color accents, margin, section headers.
	7.	Live Preview & Iteration
	•	Side-by-side: Original vs. Tailored
	•	Inline suggestions: “Consider adding X% growth metric here.”
	•	One-click accept or manual edit.
	8.	Export & Share
	•	Formats: DOCX, PDF, TXT, MD.
	•	ATS-safe plain text fallback.
	•	Cloud links for recruiters; e-mail metadata (optional).
	9.	Analytics & Feedback Loop
	•	Track which templates and recommendations users prefer.
	•	A/B test template variations.
	•	Continuously refine taxonomy and embedding model.
